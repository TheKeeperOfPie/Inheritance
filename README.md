# Inheritance

An Ethereum smart contract which holds funds for the owner, to be released to beneficiaries upon prolonged disuse of their private key. This may occur due to death, imprisonment, amnesia, lack of network access, or by simply forgetting the private key used to create the contract.

This contract was based off [Rideron85's](https://github.com/Rideron85) [PersonalBank](https://github.com/EtherDogs/PersonalBank) with some changes improve logic and fix bugs.
